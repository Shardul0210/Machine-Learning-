#Project 1:
 Heart disease classification model (Jupyter notebook);
 processed.cleveland.data (dataset); Description(Imported data.
Identified and dealt with missing data.
Formatted the data for Decision Trees using One-Hot Encoding.
Built a Preliminary Decision Tree for Classification (Recall =79%).
Pruned the Decision Tree with Cost Complexity Pruning.
Built,Drew,Interpreted and Evaluated the final Decision Tree.
Recall= 85%, Precesion= 77.78%, Accuracy 82.67%, F1_score =0.8115.)
 
#Project 2:
House price prediction kaggle competition:
Train and test datasets were given. Cleaned both datasets and took care of null values using mean for numerical and mode for categorical data;
Drop the columns having more than 50% of null values;Combined testand train for one hot encoding and then split again;
Remove the house price column from the test data to form X_train and y_train dataframes; Used Xgboost regressor for training the data. Used the model to predict 
house prices in test dataset;Submitted the prediction file sample_submission2.csv on kaggle. Rank: 1745; Mean Squared Error: 0.14257

#Project 3:
Car Price Prediction:
IdentiÔ¨Åed and Dealt with missing data, modelling the data using one-hot encoding .
Modelled data using using one-hot coding for one-hot encoding.
Used Random Forest Regressor model and pruned the model with RandomisedSearchCV to find best parameters.
MSE: 1.158 RMSE: 1.076
