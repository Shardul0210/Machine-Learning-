# Project 1:
 Heart disease classification model (Jupyter notebook);
 processed.cleveland.data (dataset); Description(Imported data.
Identified and dealt with missing data.
Formatted the data for Decision Trees using One-Hot Encoding.
Built a Preliminary Decision Tree for Classification (Recall =79%).
Pruned the Decision Tree with Cost Complexity Pruning.
Built,Drew,Interpreted and Evaluated the final Decision Tree.
Recall= 85%, Precesion= 77.78%, Accuracy 82.67%, F1_score =0.8115.)
